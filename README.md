## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm an Undergrad Student studying Security Informatics at Indiana University Bloomington.

I love learning about recent techological advances and the progress with A.I. and Machine Learning.

I'm learning Java in order to make a better Minecraft update since Mojang is incompetent.
